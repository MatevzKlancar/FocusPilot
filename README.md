## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables

- **`goals`** - User goals with titles, descriptions, and target dates
- **`tasks`** - Individual tasks linked to goals with due dates and recurrence settings
- **`streaks`** - User streak tracking with current and best streaks

### Key Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Users can only access their own data
- **Automatic Timestamps** - `created_at` and `updated_at` fields
- **Streak Triggers** - Automatic streak updates when tasks are completed
- **Helper Functions** - `get_today_tasks()`, `update_streak()`, etc.

## ü§ñ AI System

### Available Tools

- **`create_goal_with_breakdown`** - Creates goals with automatic task breakdown
- **`create_task`** - Adds individual tasks to existing goals
- **`complete_task`** - Marks tasks as done and updates streaks
- **`get_today_tasks`** - Retrieves today's focus items
- **`get_goal_tasks`** - Shows all tasks for a specific goal

### How It Works

1. **Goal Analysis**: AI analyzes your goal and determines the best breakdown strategy
2. **Task Generation**: Creates daily, weekly, and milestone tasks based on goal type
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors completion and adjusts recommendations
4. **Coaching**: Provides motivational guidance tailored to your progress style

### Example Breakdown

**Goal**: "Learn Spanish in 6 months"
**Daily Time**: 30 minutes

**Generated Tasks**:

- Daily: "Practice Spanish - 30 minutes" (recurring)
- Daily: "Complete Duolingo lesson" (recurring)
- Weekly: "Spanish conversation practice" (recurring)
- Milestone: "Complete beginner course" (due in 30 days)
- Milestone: "Hold 5-minute conversation" (due in 60 days)
